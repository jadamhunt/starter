# Starter repo

This is a "Starter" Repo(sitory) for beginning your version control journey! \
GitHub is hosted service for managing your version-controlled projects, but you could just as easily implement gitLab on a self-hosted platform for:
  - Code collaboration
  - Documentation
  - Collections 
  - Branching projects
  - and much more!

The presence of a `.git\` directory, a hidden path that controls information about the repo (project), it's branches, and the working `head`.

In this starter [repo](https://github.com/jadamhunt/starter), you'll find some shared resources, links and a glossary of common version-control terminology.

**Enjoy!**
V/r,
